              <p>
                Hi my name is Preston Ramsey! I'm a MERN stack developer with a
                self-taught background in PC assembly and design. I graduated
                from the University of California, Berkeley with a certification
                in Full-Stack Web Development with a 3.8 GPA. I take pride in my
                positive client interactions and feedback. I strive for the
                balance of efficiency and attractiveness in both development and
                PC construction. Whenever I'm not on my computer I enjoy being
                outdoors, or at social gatherings.
